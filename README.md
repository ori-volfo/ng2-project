# Ng2Project
This is my first Angular 2 project.
The purpose of it was to apply my Angular 2 and TypeScript knowledge and build a Single Page Application website using the routing module. 
The apps can be found under the "Projects" tab.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.3.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng g component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
